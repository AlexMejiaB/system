### Authentication Flow Verification

#### NextAuth.js Configuration
- **Strategy**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Session Duration**: 30 days
- **Provider**: Credentials (email/password)
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs for secure password comparison

#### Middleware Protection
- **Protected Routes**: `/dashboard`, `/bolt`, `/hr`, `/incidents`, `/labor-calculations`, `/reports`
- **Public Routes**: `/`, `/login`
- **Redirect Logic**: Unauthenticated users → `/login`, Authenticated users from `/login` → `/`

#### Session Management
- **JWT Callbacks**: User ID and role stored in token
- **Session Callbacks**: User data populated in session object
- **Authorization**: Route-level protection implemented

### Demo Accounts Available

The system includes pre-configured demo accounts for testing different roles:

1. **Admin**: admin@company.com / admin123
   - Full system access
   - All modules and features available

2. **HR**: hr@company.com / hr123

### Security Features Confirmed

1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords stored using bcryptjs
2. **JWT Security**: Tokens signed with NEXTAUTH_SECRET
3. **Route Protection**: Middleware prevents unauthorized access
4. **Session Validation**: Automatic token validation on each request
5. **Secure Cookies**: NextAuth.js handles secure cookie management

### Conclusion

The JWT authentication system is **fully functional and secure**. All authentication flows work correctly, protected routes are properly secured, and role-based access control is implemented and working as expected.
